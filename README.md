# About This Repo

This is a repository containing my notes on the rooms I've completed in TryHackMe, as well as how I answered the questions in each room. As the description suggests, this is far from being a complete repository of all my notes, but I wanted to share what I have anyway. There are also things I need to clean up as far as formatting and writing style goes (I tend to be a little informal when I explain things - many of the earlier documents in this repo are evidence for this).

## Layout and Structure

I've been working on getting my notes together for the learning paths I've completed. I try to follow the structure provided in the learning paths themselves, and the files are named as they are in accordance with this. For instance, "s01r01" would refer to the first section of the learning path, and the first room of this section. If nothing else, this helps keep my notes in order with the rooms provided in TryHackMe.

In the notes themselves, I go over the questions provided in each room. These are denoted as **[Task #, Question #]** - for the purposes of numbering, I only count questions in tasks where you are expected to give an answer. Screenshots and such are provided to help illustrate how I go about answering these questions.
