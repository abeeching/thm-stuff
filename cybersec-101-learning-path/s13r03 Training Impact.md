# Training Impact on Teams

## [Task 1] Understanding the Impact of Cyber Security Training

Practice and training plays a huge role in mastering a skill, and the same can be said for any cybersecurity-related skills. Everyone needs to gain relevant skills and work diligently in order to keep up to date and build upon them. There are certain requirements, though, that make training cybersecurity skills trickier. You'll need a computer lab environment for yourself (you wouldn't want to risk harming actual production systems, right?) to practice, or you'll need to make use of training platforms.

Training is incredibly important in cybersecurity - it's better to learn about things in a training environment and not during a live incident. It also helps improve the quality of the cybersecurity team's work, which can help reduce the likelihood of incidents. Training is also good for the organization, since it increases the team's capacity without hiring additional team members. The team will be prepared to handle what comes their way. It makes it feasible to hire junior people if needed, and it gives them the means to ramp up quickly. There's no need to retrain the same material over and over again.

Centralized training creates a baseline with which an organization can assess skills, knowledge, and development. Required skills can be described more specifically, making it easier to make informed decisions in assigning tasks to an employee or team. Insights into an employee's current skills can clarify the path they must follow to tkae the next step.

Also, training can be fun (e.g., in capture-the-flag/CTF challenges).

**[Task 1, Question 1] What is the most efficient way to ramp up the skills of a junior hire in cybersecurity?** - Training

## [Task 2] Cyber Security Training for Large Organizations

Off-the-shelf training makes sense for smaller teams, though if a team exceeds a certain size (typically beyond 20 employees), or if very specific training is required, you can customize existing training options as needed. TryHackMe has Content Studio, which allows organizations to modify or create modules based on their needs and priorities. This helps increase the efficacy of users' training. Large corporations may also need a solution that can be integrated into their existing software landscape; usually this will require a training solution that supports single sign-on (SSO) and well-documented APIs.

## [Task 3] Write a Cyber Security Training Investment Proposal

Companies invest in employees as they may also invest in their assets. You might need to make a case to your company to convince them of good training. Numbers usually make a good language to communicate this in. Say a cybersecurity team has ten employees, and each employee costs $80,000 annually. Let's then assume that training increases productivity by 4%. If we trained all ten employees, then the savings or gains due to this are $32,000. Multiply 10 x 4% x $80,000 to get this result.

If the cost of training is, say, $500 for one employee, then the total cost of training is $5,000 (or 10 x $500). The return on investment (ROI) in this case is 640%, or $32,000 / $5,000 = 640%.

A sample training investment proposal is provided in the room to give an idea of how to write a good one.

The first question assumes that a team has 20 employees, each employee costing $50,000 annually. We assume training increases productivity by 4%. Doing the same math as above, we see that the savings would be 20 x $50,000 x 4%, or $40,000.

**[Task 3, Question 1] What would be the savings due to the increased productivity?** - 40000

This next question assumes that it costs $500 to train an employee. With this in mind we know that training 20 employees costs $10,000. Bearing this in mind, the return on investment will be $40,000 / $10,000... or 400%.

**[Task 3, Question 2] Assuming that training costs $500 per employee, what is the Return on Investment?** - 400%

## [Task 4] Vendor Selection

Here are some questions to consider when choosing a training vendor:
1. Who are you buying the training for?
2. What are the experience, background, role, and topics relevant to your employees?
3. Does the vendor have experience with similar organizations?
4. What is the content's breadth, depth, and quality for the topics you care about?
5. Can users learn, train, and practice on a single platform?
6. What is the cost of training? Note that this question is primarily important just for the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and those kinds of folks.

## [Task 5] Conclusion

In summary, training is critical for improving a cybersecurity team's performance. There are folks believe in life-long learning, and understandably companies will encourage (and perhaps require) employees to undergo regular training. This can be rewarding both for the trainees and the employers.

TryHackMe provides options for learning in an organization as well as learning in an educational institution (such as schools and colleges). They're worth checking out!
